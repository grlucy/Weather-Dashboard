# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

A weather dashboard that provides current conditions, 5-day forecast, and search history. I made this site fully responsive through Bootstrap and media queries. It is deployed on Github Pages at: https://grlucy.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

This web browser application is intended for monitoring current weather conditions and looking up weather forecasts in different cities. Geolocation also provides weather in the user's current location. A search history feature enables the user to click on convenient buttons for cities they have previously searched.

Technologies used:

> HTML, Git, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, the OpenWeather API, and the Geolocation API

## Usage

The first time a user loads the application, they will be asked to confirm geolocation services. If they accept, the weather dashboard displays weather for their current location and adds their current location to search history. If they do not accept, the dashboard defaults to University of Richmond's coordinates.

The user is then able to search for other cities, and the current weather and 5-day forecast for those cities appears to the right. Every time the user searches for a city, a clickable button will be added to search history to serve as a convenient shortcut.
