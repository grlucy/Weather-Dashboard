# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is the site I made for the University of Richmond Bootcamp Homework #6: Weather Dashboard assignment. I used HTML, Git, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, the OpenWeather API, and the Geolocation API to develop a weather dashboard. I made this site fully responsive through Bootstrap and media queries. It is deployed on Github Pages at: https://grlucy.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

This web browser application is intended for monitoring current weather conditions and looking up weather forecasts in different cities. Geolocation also provides weather in the user's current location. A search history feature enables the user to click on convenient buttons for cities they have previously searched.

In building this weather dashboard, I learned about using the OpenWeather API and the Geolocation API. I also learned how to use Moment.js to format timestamps from an API.
